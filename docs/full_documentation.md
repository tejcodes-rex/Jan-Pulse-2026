# Problem Statement
========================================

# Problem Statement: The "Silent" Exclusion
    
While Aadhaar coverage is near-universal/saturation, "Dormancy" is the new exclusion. millions of residents hold valid IDs but represent "Dead Signals" in the database—no updates, no authentications, no linkage to services.

# The Jan-Pulse Approach
We shifted from "Stock Analysis" (Who has Aadhaar?) to "Flow Analysis" (Who is using Aadhaar?). By analyzing update velocity (Demographic/Biometric), we triangulated three critical signals:
1. Ghost Children (School Dropouts)
2. Workforce Velocity (Migration Corridors)
3. Digital Dark Zones (Financial Exclusion)


# Datasets & Methodology
========================================

# 2. Datasets Used: High-Fidelity State-Wise Ingestion

Instead of relying on pre-aggregated national snapshots, we programmatically ingested the State-wise raw data streams to ensure zero loss of granularity at the PIN Code level.

## Data Volume Processed
- **Total Files:** 206+ CSV Files (covering 36 States & UTs).
- **Architecture:** Custom Map-Reduce pipeline used to merge state-level fragments into a unified National Master Database.

## Dataset Details

| Dataset Name | Source Format | Granularity | Specific Application in Jan-Pulse |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Aadhaar Enrolment** | State-wise CSVs | PIN Code / Monthly | Used to establish the "Birth Cohort" (0-5 Years) baseline for every specific district, avoiding national-average generalizations. |
| **2. Aadhaar Biometric Update** | State-wise CSVs | PIN Code / Monthly | Filtered specifically for "Mandatory Biometric Updates" (Age 5/15) to detect school-entry compliance gaps. |
| **3. Aadhaar Demographic Update** | State-wise CSVs | PIN Code / Monthly | Used to track "Update Velocity" of Mobile and Address fields to identify migration corridors and digital dark zones. |

> **Data Integrity Note:** By processing state-wise files, our pipeline successfully identified and sanitized metadata inconsistencies (e.g., normalizing "West Bengli" to "West Bengal" and re-mapping mislabeled districts like "Tuensang") which are often masked in the national aggregate file.


# Technical Approach
========================================

# Technical Methodology: Map-Reduce & Triangulation

## 1. Map-Reduce Architecture
To process high-volume distributed CSVs without memory overflow:
- **Map**: Processed each file individually, standardizing dates (YYYY-MM) and scrubbing filename-based state labels.
- **Reduce**: Aggregated data chunks into condensed "Master" datasets using `pandas.melt` for schema normalization.

## 2. Triangulation Logic
We derived "Indices" rather than raw counts:
- **Dropout Risk**: Compared `Enrolment Cohort (Age 0-5)` vs `Biometric Updates (Age 5-17)`. A lag suggests school exclusion.
- **Migration Velocity**: High volume of Adult Demographic updates proxies labor movement.
